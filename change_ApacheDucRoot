You'll have to edit apache2.conf and 000-default.conf to change the document root of apache.

The Apache server is installed on var/www/html.This is the default root directory of apache.

Either change the root directory of Apache or move the project to /var/www/html.

    To change Apache's root directory, run:

    cd /etc/apache2/sites-available

    Then open the 000-default.conf file using the command:

    nano 000-default.conf

    Edit the DocumentRoot option:

    DocumentRoot /path/to/my/project

    Then restart the apache server:

    sudo service apache2 restart

If you get Forbidden You don't have permission to access / on this server after changing the root of apache then do follow these steps

    Find the apache2.conf located in /etc/apache2 and open it using:

    nano apache2.conf

    Use Ctrl+W and search for Directory (It should be in line 153)

    It should look like this

    <Directory />
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all denied
    </Directory>

    Change it to

    <Directory />
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
        
        </Directory>

Restart apache

sudo service apache2 restart
