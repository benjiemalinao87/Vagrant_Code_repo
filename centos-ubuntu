Step 1 — Installing Jenkins

The version of Jenkins included with the default Ubuntu packages is often behind the latest available version from the project itself. In order to take advantage of the latest fixes and features, we'll use the project-maintained packages to install Jenkins.

First, we'll add the repository key to the system.

    wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -

When the key is added, the system will return OK. Next, we'll append the Debian package repository address to the server's sources.list:

    echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list

When both of these are in place, we'll run update so that apt-get will use the new repository:

    sudo apt-get update

Finally, we'll install Jenkins and its dependencies, including Java:

    sudo apt-get install jenkins

Now that Jenkins and its dependencies are in place, we'll start the Jenkins server.
Step 2 — Starting Jenkins

Using systemctl we'll start Jenkins:

sudo systemctl start jenkins

Since systemctl doesn't display output, we'll use its status command to verify that it started successfully:

    sudo systemctl status jenkins

If everything went well, the beginning of the output should show that the service is active and configured to start at boot:

Output
● jenkins.service - LSB: Start Jenkins at boot time
  Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/jenkins; bad; vendor preset: enabled)
  Active:active (exited) since Thu 2017-04-20 16:51:13 UTC; 2min 7s ago
    Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)

Now that Jenkins is running, we'll adjust our firewall rules so that we can reach Jenkins from a web browser to complete the initial set up.
Step 3 — Opening the Firewall

By default, Jenkins runs on port 8080, so we'll open that port using ufw:

    sudo ufw allow 8080

We can see the new rules by checking UFW's status.

    sudo ufw status

We should see that traffic is allowed to port 8080 from anywhere:

Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
8080                       ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
8080 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

Note: If the firewall is inactive, the following commands will make sure that OpenSSH is allowed and then enable it.

    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    sudo ufw enable

Now that Jenkins is installed and the firewall allows us to access it, we can complete the initial setup.
Step 4 — Setting up Jenkins

To set up our installation, we'll visit Jenkins on its default port, 8080, using the server domain name or IP address: http://ip_address_or_domain_name:8080
